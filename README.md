#Problem
Develop a function that takes one string input of any number of integers separated by single whitespace. 
The function then outputs the longest increasing subsequence (increased by any number) present in that sequence. 
If more than 1 sequence exists with the longest length, output the earliest one. You may develop supporting functions as many as you find reasonable.

#Test cases
11 Test cases and additional 8 test cases to test null values and other conditions have been added.

#Docker
Docker image and container setup complete. For docker compose, the service name is test
"docker-compose run test" will print the test results as below -

Set up CI/CD in Github Actions for .NET. Can possibly be done for Docker as well.
